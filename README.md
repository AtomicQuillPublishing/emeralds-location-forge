This project is a simple, interactive website that generates a random location name for use in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and other tabletop RPGs. It's designed to inspire players and Dungeon Masters by generating unique names for towns, cities, and kingdoms at the click of a button. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a fantasy-inspired background and styling for an immersive experience.
